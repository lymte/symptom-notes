                <h2>Bone Pain</h2>
                <p id="overview">Bone pain is a symptom of bone damage caused by inflammation, trauma, changes in internal bone pressure, and other factors that can result in pain.
The following disease can cause the bone pain</p>
                <p id="notes"> <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Fatigue fracture</span> 
                    <br/>Fatigue fractures are fractures of healthy bone tissue. Gradually increasing pain at the site of injury is the main symptom.
Although chronic injury is the basic cause of fatigue fracture, it has different factors when it occurs in different parts of the body.
Because the fractures are mostly without displacement, only local firm external fixation and correct rehabilitation function exercises. Proper treatment can lead to good results, but before beginning training, you must have a proper plan to correct wrong movements and posture to avoid further injury.

                <p id="notes"> <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Ischemic osteonecrosis</span> 
                    <br/>Ischemic osteonecrosis is the death of bone cells due to a block of the blood supply.
Ischemic osteonecrosis is caused by the destruction of the blood supply by different causes.
The most common sites of ischemic osteonecrosis were the femoral head, head of the humerus, talus, and scaphoid of the wrist. 
Whether the patients will take the surgeries depend on their specific condition.
                </p>
                <p id="notes"> <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>leukemia</span> 
                    <br/>When leukemia cells multiply in large numbers in the bone marrow cavity, there will be high pressure, a large number of leukemia cells will accumulate, and leukemia will appear with bone pain symptoms.
If a leukemia patient develops bone pain early, it usually occurs in the limb or back.
Due to the lack of blood supply to the bone area, and cancer cells invading the bone, early leukemia usually causes pain in the bone.
If you have leukemia, and the early symptom of bone pain, it is recommended to follow the doctor's advice to improve the bone marrow puncture examination to determine the severity of the disease. Then according to the specific situation of the patient, make a specific treatment plan.          
                </p>

                <p id="notes"> <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Lymphoma</span> 
                    <br/>Lymphoma is also likely to cause bone pain. Lymphoma usually leads to bone marrow infiltration, if there are more lymphoma cells in the bone marrow, then it may cause the destruction of bone, then it may cause bone pain.
If the bone pain is caused by lymphoma, and the lymphoma is controlled with active anti-tumor therapy, the bone pain may be relieved or even disappear.          
                </p>

                <p id="notes">
                All in all, bone pain is a complex problem and it can be caused by a lot of factors. Sometimes, it may disappear after a few days. But if individuals experience it for a long period of time, it is necessary to go to the hospital for professional treatment to avoid the further development of the disease.

                    <br/>Asthma is a disease of the lungs, most are caused by inflammatory stimulation and allergen stimulation.
Dyspnea occurs because inflammatory stimulation or allergen stimulation can narrow the airway and prevent normal breathing.
Asthma cannot be cured completely and individuals usually take some medicines to attenuate symptoms. Also, patients can take the surgery called bronchial thermoplastic to help the patients to have less difficulty in breathing.

When the virus enters the lungs, reaches the alveoli, and blocks the bronchial tubes, it will cause them to narrow. At that time, there will be symptoms of cough, hemoptysis, low fever, and other discomfort. If left untreated and the condition gets worse, a large amount of pleural effusion will press on lung tissue, and seriously affects air exchange function, resulting in breathing difficulties.

If diagnosed with phthisis, it is necessary to take the medicines according to the doctor's guidance.
If it cannot be improved by conservative treatment, lobectomy or pneumonectomy is also necessary (surgery).

                    <br/>Infection is the most common cause of hemoptysis, which is responsible for 60-70% of the total cases (American Family Physician). The infection will lead to inflammation and then leads to the rupture of the blood vessels and finally lead to hemoptysis.

                    <br/>When the bronchial tubes are infected, it may cause continuous dilation, leading to the airway block. If the bronchial tube wall is damaged, it may cause capillaries to rupture, and then a change in the color of the sputum may occur during coughing. Drugs such as amoxicillin capsules can be taken orally for anti-inflammatory treatment. 
But it is important to go to the hospital for proper diagnosis and treatment.

            <h2>Knee Pain</h2>
                <p id="overview">Knee pain usually can be shown through knee swelling, limited extension, and flexion function.
There are many factors that can lead to knee pain, which include the weather, disease, bad living habits, and medicines. Knee pain can also be an indication of height growth for teenagers. However, some diseases can lead to knee pain and may cause serious results if patients do not receive proper treatments.</p>

                    <br/>Aging, obesity, and congenital joint abnormalities are a few of the causes of degenerative osteoarthritis.
The increase in age will lead to a gradual narrowing of the joint space, and this damage is irreversible. There will be obvious joint pain, swelling, limited activity, and other manifestations.
Also, it causes a series of serious complications such as muscle atrophy and joint malformation and even affects the normal life of patients.
At present, the main method is to relieve symptoms, extend the life of the joint, and reduce pain.

                    <br/>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic disease of unknown etiology, mainly inflammatory synovitis. It is more common in women, and the incidence is 2-3 times higher than that in men. It can occur at any age, with a peak age of 40 to 60 years old.
Knee pain is very common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. If swelling and pain in the knee joint occur in the early stage, timely treatment can avoid further development of the disease.
The main goal of rheumatoid arthritis treatment is to reduce joint inflammation and protect the function of joints and muscles as much as possible.
It must be emphasized that functional exercise is an important method to maintain joint function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. When the patients feel joint swelling and pain, joint activity should be appropriately restricted. However, once the swelling pain has reduced, functional exercise should be done without increasing the patient's pain.

                    <br/>It is a common and complex form of arthritis that people of all ages may have and is more common in men than in women.
Gout is a disease caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, resulting in the deposit of uric acid crystals in the joints, which leads to inflammation of the joints.
When gout is severe, it can result in joint deformities, bone destruction, and even fractures.
When it affects the kidneys, it can result in glomerulonephritis and kidney function damage.
The goal of gout treatment is to prevent the formation of uric acid crystals and reduce the resulting serious joint injury, and kidney damage.
Lifestyle adjustments can help prevent and treat gout and reduce the excess production of uric acid.
When it is severe, it is necessary to take some medicine according to the doctor's guidance or take the surgeries.

                    <br/>Tendons are strong fibrous connective tissue that connects bones to muscles. Myotenositis is usually caused by the overuse of muscle fibers and repeated strong pulling.

Ice is usually used for the treatment of myotenositis.
Severe pain can be locally injected with steroid hormones, which can control inflammation and reduce pain. However, repeated steroid injections are not recommended because multiple injections can weaken the tendon and lead to tendon rupture.
Taking a thermomassage can help raise your body temperature and improve blood circulation.
Surgery can also be used to treat myotenositis if other methods are not useful, but there will be big trauma, big pain, and a long recovery period.
