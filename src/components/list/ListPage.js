Drugs such as amoxicillin capsules can be taken orally for anti-inflammatory treatment. 
But it is important to go to the hospital for proper diagnosis and treatment.

The stress may make the body release certain types of hormones such as adrenaline and then make the muscle tense up and finally leading to a headache.
Meanwhile, stress can sometimes make people skip meals, smoke or drink alcohol, and indirectly leads to headaches.
Also, stress makes us more sensitive to pain and then exacerbates existing headaches.

Anemia reduces the number of red blood cells in the body. Then, there is also a decrease in oxygen transport in the blood, which may lead to a lack of oxygen to the brain, causing headaches.
The occurrence of headaches for leukemia patients may also be caused by leukemia cells spreading to the brain through the blood, causing the expansion of blood vessels in the brain.
