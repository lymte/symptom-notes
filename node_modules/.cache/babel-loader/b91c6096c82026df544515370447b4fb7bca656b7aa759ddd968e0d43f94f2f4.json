If swelling and pain in the knee joint occur in the early stage, timely treatment can avoid further development of the disease.\nThe main goal of rheumatoid arthritis treatment is to reduce joint inflammation and protect the function of joints and muscles as much as possible.\nIt must be emphasized that functional exercise is an important method to maintain joint function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. When the patients feel joint swelling and pain, joint activity should be appropriately restricted.

However, repeated steroid injections are not recommended because multiple injections can weaken the tendon and lead to tendon rupture.\nTaking a thermomassage can help raise your body temperature and improve blood circulation.\nSurgery can also be used to treat myotenositis if other methods are not useful, but there will be big trauma, big pain, and a long recovery period.\n\n                </p>\n                <p id=\"notes\"> <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Synovitis</span> \n                    <br/> Synovitis is a joint disease in which the synovial membrane is stimulated to produce inflammation, resulting in secretion imbalance and accumulation of fluid.\nThe knee joint is the joint with the most synovitis in the whole body, so the knee joint is more common.\nIt may cause congestion or edema.
